REST API for forgottenserver (https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) database management

JMaker exposes REST API to work with forgottenserver database. Creators of this application are trying to keep all communication asynchronous.

JMaker uses WebFlux and r2dbc to take advantage of reactive approach.
