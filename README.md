REST API for [forgottenserver](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) database management

JMaker exposes REST API to work with forgottenserver database. Creators of this application are trying to keep all communication asynchronous.

JMaker uses [WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html) and [R2DBC](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/r2dbc/docs/1.1.1.RELEASE/reference/html/#get-started:first-steps:what) to take advantage of reactive approach.
